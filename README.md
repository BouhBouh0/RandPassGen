<p> This Python code defines a simple password generator. It uses the random and string modules to create a password with a default length of 12 characters, combining letters, digits, and punctuation. The password_generator() function randomly selects characters from these sets and joins them into a single string. The generated password is then printed using an f-string. This approach ensures a quick and easy way to create strong, random passwords.</p>
